snapshot-btrfs is a tool offer btrfser eazier way to do daily snapshot work. It's merges some code and ideal from https://github.com/mk01/btrfs-auto-snapshot. But they use different base way to manage snapshot.

snapshot-btrfs only focus on those btrfs subvolumn which currently mount on system. Eeach subvolumn has a directory .btrfs to save individual setting and snapshot. For management reason, it create readonly snapshot to prevent careless mody to snapsot. Before auto-snapshot command work. You moust run mark-auto to tell snapshot-btrffs to incldue this mount point when doing auto-snapshot.

Just like btrfs-autosnapshot and zfs-autosnapshot, It use crontab to invoke program for daily automatic snapshot. Different crontab implement has little different from setting and working. You should check if snapshot-btrfs work currently for your system or do some fix from snapshot-btrfs.cron to suit your system.
